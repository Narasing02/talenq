Sections are loaded from JSON data and can be expanded to view associated cards.
Users can click on section tabs to switch between sections.

Cards come in various types, such as text, numbers, images, and tags.
Cards may also include optional buttons and links.

Responsive Design:

The dashboard is designed to adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
Media queries and responsive design techniques ensure that the content is accessible and user-friendly on different devices.
Performance Optimization:

Performance is optimized through techniques like lazy loading and code splitting.
Lazy loading ensures that assets are loaded only when needed, reducing initial load times.
Code splitting improves loading efficiency by splitting code into smaller, manageable chunks.
These features collectively create a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard experience, allowing users to explore content efficiently while customizing the visual theme based on their preferences.
